# Chatbot
Some people genuinely dislike human interaction. Whenever they are forced to socialize or go to events that involve lots of people, they feel detached and awkward. Personally, I believe that Iâ€™m most extroverted because I gain energy from interacting with other people. There are plenty of people on this Earth who are the exact opposite, who get very drained from social interaction.A chatbot is an intelligent piece of software that is capable of communicating and performing actions similar to a human. Chatbots are used a lot in customer interaction, marketing on social network sites and instantly messaging the client. There are two basic types of chatbot models based on how they are built; Retrieval based and Generative based models.
